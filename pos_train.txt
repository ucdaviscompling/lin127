Hello .	UH .
I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .	PRP VBD RB VBG IN VBG DT NNP CC NNP JJ NN .
I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .	PRP VBD PRP CC VBD DT IN DT NN IN NNP , NNP NNP .
They should be delivered this week .	PRP MD VB VBN DT NN .
They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .	PRP VBP JJ CC MD VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .	IN DT NN DT NNP VBZ RB CC VBG IN PRP$ JJ NN NN CC PRP VBZ JJ .
I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .	PRP VBP RB VBN DT NNP IN DT JJ NN .
I am interested in several artists .	PRP VBP JJ IN JJ NNS .
Actually , a lot .	RB , DT NN .
I will be looking for one or more of the following .	PRP MD VB VBG IN CD CC JJR IN DT VBG .

I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs. my wife 's favorites and priorities ) .	PRP VBD DT IN PRP$ -LRB- RB PRP IN PRP$ NN POS NNS CC NNS -RRB- .
They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .	PRP VBP RB RB IN NN NN CC IN PRP VBD IN PRP VBP DT NN WDT PRP VBP PRP MD VB PRP .

I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .	PRP VBP IN DT VBD RB VBN IN DT NN CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN NN .
I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .	PRP RB VBP IN DT MD RB VB VBN DT NNS IN NN CC PRP VBP RB JJ .

1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i.e. , ONSI would be a lot more money ) .	LS . DT NN WDT PRP VBP VBN NNP VBZ JJ IN NNP NNP CC MD RB VB JJ IN VBG DT NN -LRB- FW , NNP MD VB DT NN JJR NN -RRB- .

2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .	LS . DT NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT NNP NN .
In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .	IN NN TO VB DT CD NN , PRP MD VB TO VB NNP TO VB DT NN NN IN CD .

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .	PRP VBP IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB DT NN VBG PRP$ JJ NN NNS , CC PRP VBP IN DT RBS JJ NN , JJ IN DT JJ NN CC DT NNS IN NN .
On the means of delivery , I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent .	IN DT NNS IN NN , PRP VBP RB JJ IN PRP$ NN IN CC RB PRP RB VBP DT NN .
Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition is a letter to be sent under John 's name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent ) ?	VBZ EX DT NN TO VB VBN IN DT NNP NN CC IN NN VBZ DT NN TO VB VBN IN NNP POS NN -LRB- IN RB , IN WP MD DT NN VB VBN -RRB- .
Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?	CC VBZ DT NN IN NNP DT NN TO VB VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN .
With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .	IN NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBP IN CD IN DT JJ NNS IN JJ NN NNS VBP IN PRP VBP VBN TO VB JJ IN NN , VBN IN DT NN CC DT NN WRB PRP VBP IN NN NNS .
With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .	IN DT NN NNS VBN RB , PRP MD VB IN NNS NNS IN NN VBZ VBG VBN CC PRP MD VB JJ TO VB NNP NN NN IN EX VBZ NN IN NN NNS RB .
These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .	DT JJ NNS RB MD VB NNP TO VB PRP$ NN NN RBR RB , IN RB VBN NNS IN NN IN NN NNS .
I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .	PRP VBP RB JJ IN DT NN IN VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ RB .
Finally , a question regarding timing .	RB , DT NN VBG NN .
The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent 's return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .	DT JJ PRP VBD IN PRP CC NNP VBD DT NN NN IN JJ NN NNS VBD IN DT VBD VBG VBN -LRB- NNP VBD DT TO VB IN NNP POS NN IN NNP -RRB- IN NNS IN DT NN NNS .
I do n't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .	PRP VBP RB VB IN PRP VBP RB IN DT NN WRB PRP MD VB IN DT NN NNS RB VBP VBN , VBP CC VBP VBN DT NNS .
And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .	CC RB TO VB DT NN IN VBG DT NNS , DT JJ NN -LRB- CC DT JJ NN IN DT -RRB- MD VB DT JJ NN NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NNS .
My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .	PRP$ NN IN NNP NNP VBZ IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .	EX VBZ JJ NN TO VB IN VBG DT NN CC NN IN DT NN CC RB JJR NN TO VB TO VB JJ NNS IN NN IN VBG DT NN .
Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this , and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New .	NNP VBZ VBN NNP NNP TO VB IN DT , CC PRP VBP IN NNP VBZ RB VBN VBG IN NNP NNP .
So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against .	RB PRP VBP IN CC RB PRP VBP TO VB NN IN JJ NNS WDT PRP MD RB RB VB IN .
Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?

Steve :	NNP :
At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .	IN DT NN , PRP$ NN NNS VBP VBG DT NN CC VBG PRP MD VB DT NN CC NN NN NNS .
There are still four important issues , however :	EX VBP RB CD JJ NNS , RB :
IT still can not commit to transferring messages across domains .	NN RB MD RB VB IN VBG NNS IN NNS .
This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .	DT VBZ IN NNS VBN IN NNP CC VBN IN DT JJ NNP NN MD RB VB DT NN NNS IN DT NNP NN .
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .	DT NNS MD VB DT NNP NN IN NNP VBZ RB TO VB PRP$ JJ NN NN NN , NNP , CC MD VB NNP RB .
WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .	NNP VBZ VBN IN NNP , IN PRP VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN .
HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses can not be made anonymous .	NN , VBN TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN , MD RB VB NNP IN NN NNS MD RB VB VBN JJ .
HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .	NN VBZ RB VBN DT NN VBN NNP WDT MD VB JJ NNS .
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .	NNS MD RB VB VBN RB IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NN , CC MD PRP VB VBN IN CD IN CD NNS IN PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN NN .
Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users can not retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e-mail ) .	DT NN TO VB VBZ IN DT NNS MD VB JJ TO VB CC VB IN DT VBN NN IN NN , VBG NNS MD RB VB PRP CC VB PRP RB -LRB- IN PRP MD IN NN -RRB- .
This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .	DT VBZ IN PRP MD VB RB IN DT NN IN JJ NNS CC VB DT NN RB , IN PRP MD VB VBN CC VBN IN DT NN PRP VBD .
The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .	DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT JJ NNS IN NN VBP VBG DT NN , CC PRP VBP JJ NN .
They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .	PRP VBP VBG NNP MD VB DT NN IN DT NN WDT MD VB PRP TO RB VB DT NN IN VBG PRP NN HYPH RB .

Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15 MM collateral threshold .	RB NNP CC NNP VBP DT CD CD NN NN .
If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .	IN JJ , PRP VBP DT JJS NN TO VB DT NN MD VB TO VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN .
We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .	PRP MD RB VB IN DT NN NN CC MD VB RP DT RB JJ NN NN NN IN DT NN .
We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .	PRP MD RB VB DT CD NN VBN IN NN NN IN DT NN NN .

Dear Justin	JJ NNP
Marly asked me to respond to you .	NNP VBD PRP TO VB IN PRP .
As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .	IN PRP VBP , DT NN NN VBZ RB JJ CC RB VBN IN JJ NNS .
Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .	RB , DT NN NN NN WDT VBZ DT NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBP PRP MD RB VB PRP$ NN TO VB NNS IN VBG DT NN NN .
Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ) , I 'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .

Randy , this is the issue I left you the voice mail on .	NNP , DT VBZ DT NN PRP VBD PRP DT NN NN IN .
Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement ( which I am sending to you separately ) with ECS obligates ECS to " work in good faith with CDEC " to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC 's system .

We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to " assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses " associated with the manual system .

In the mean time , we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs .	IN DT NN NN , PRP VBP TO VB JJ IN PRP VBP VBG NN PRP MD TO VB DT NN IN DT NN TO VB JJ NNS .

James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC .

Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management .	MD PRP UH VB NNP NNP CC VB DT NNP NNP NNP NNP IN NN IN DT NN NN NN .
My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC 's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC 's peak load periods .	PRP$ NN VBD IN NNP VBD TO VB DT NN TO VB NNP POS JJ NN IN NN IN PRP TO VB DT NN TO VB VBG DT NN IN NNP POS NN NN NNS .
We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200,987.33 for the period of July through September .	PRP VBP RB VBN NN IN DT NN WDT VBZ VBN RB RB IN JJ JJ NN IN $ CD IN DT NN IN NNP IN NNP .
Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , that I have not been able to review yet .	JJ NN MD VB VBN IN DT NN IN DT NN , WDT PRP VBP RB VBN JJ TO VB RB .
This cost is averaging $ 79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .	DT NN VBZ VBG $ CD IN NN IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN PRP VBP IN NNP CC NNP .
Good point , but I 'm comfortable we 're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points .	JJ NN , CC PRP VBP JJ PRP VBP VBN IN PRP$ NNS VBD RB VBG IN DT NN IN NN CC JJ NNS .
They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights ( it s in the tariff ) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates , they could have done so .	PRP VBP VBN TO VB IN NN IN PRP VBD JJ NN NNS -LRB- PRP VBZ IN DT NN -RRB- CC IN PRP VBD TO VB DT NN WDT VBD DT JJ NN IN NNS CC NNS , PRP MD VB VBN RB .
None of them did , and most importantly , the winning bidders did not .	NN IN PRP VBD , CC RBS RB , DT VBG NNS VBD RB .
Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates .	PRP$ NN NN RB VBZ IN PRP MD VB DT JJ VBN NN IN DT NN VBZ IN NNS CC NNS .
I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down ?	PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN PRP VBP JJ IN DT CC PRP MD VB PRP VBN RB .

Bill -	NNP ,
If Sam 's description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .	IN NNP POS NN RB IN DT NN NN VBZ JJ , PRP VBZ IN PRP IN NN VBZ TO VB VBN .
The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty 's name from Global Counterparty .	DT NN VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT NN POS NN IN JJ NN .
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .	IN NNS IN NNS VBP RB JJ NNS PRP VBP RB VB DT NN TO VB IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .	IN DT JJ JJ NN VBZ RB IN JJ NN , DT NN VBZ RB IN DT JJ JJ NN IN PRP RB VBG DT NN PRP .
That is the source of Tana 's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .	DT VBZ DT NN IN NNP POS NN VBG DT JJ NN IN NNS IN DT NN .
My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .	PRP$ NN VBZ IN JJ NN VB DT JJ NN WDT DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT NNP NN NN , PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT NNP NN VBZ JJ NNS IN DT NN IN PRP VBP RB VBN .
In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .

Hello ,	UH ,
Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .	UH , NN VBZ DT NNS TO VB DT NN IN DT NN CC NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS .

We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .	PRP VBP PRP VBZ JJ IN DT NNS CC NNS PRP VBP VBN IN DT NNS .
As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *	IN DT NN , DT NN : NFP VBZ DT JJ NN NN NN IN NN NN IN DT NN CD IN CD . NFP
* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *	NFP VBZ NN NN NN NNS IN CD JJR IN JJS NNS IN NNS IN NN NN . NFP
* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *	NFP VBZ IN VBN NN NN NNS IN NN NNS . NFP
* Offers a 7.5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *	NFP VBZ DT CD NN SYM JJ NN IN JJ NNS IN VBG NN NNS IN JJ NNS , VBG DT NN IN DT NNS TO VB TO VB JJ NN NNS CC JJ NNP HYPH VBN NNS .

* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ) . *	NFP VBZ NNS TO VB NN CC VB VB NNS IN NN NN NNS , CC VBZ DT NN NNS VBN TO VB DT NNS IN DT NN IN DT NN CD NN -LRB- CD SYM CD -RRB- . NFP
* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3.5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .	NFP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN NN , IN DT CD NN NN TO VB CC NN CC DT NN IN VBN NN NNS .
The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *	DT VBN NNS MD VB JJ RB IN JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NN CC VBN NNS IN IN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS . NFP
* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *	NFP VBZ DT NN NN IN DT NN CC NN NNS , IN RB JJR IN DT JJ NN . NFP
* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *	NFP VBZ DT CD HYPH NN JJ NN IN NN NN NNS VBG IN CD , IN NN NNS VBG DT JJ NN IN JJ NN . NFP
* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .	NFP VBZ DT NN NN NN IN DT NNS .
PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today 's mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .

Jeff -	NNP ,
instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a " modest " increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim .	RB IN VBG DT JJ NN NN , CD CC CD NN , PRP VBP PRP MD VB IN DT `` JJ '' NN MD VB JJ CC MD IN NN VB JJ , CC IN DT JJ NN IN NN MD VB JJ CC JJ IN RB VBN RP NN CC NNS , CC RB VBN IN NN .
In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .	IN JJ , PRP MD RB VB RB JJ IN DT NN CC PRP VBP PRP VBP IN DT .
Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .	RB , PRP VBP PRP VBP VBN DT NNS RB .
We 're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .	PRP VBP IN DT NN IN VBG DT NN TO VB PRP IN DT JJ JJ NNS .
But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .	CC IN DT -LRB- RB JJ -RRB- NNS VBP RB JJ IN PRP$ NN IN DT NNS IN NNP CC NNP , PRP VBD TO VB RB DT NNS IN NN IN DT NNS , NNS RB .
OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for " price gouging " is increasing .	NN : DT NN TO VB NN IN `` NN NN '' VBZ VBG .
The administration is hell bent on finding a " fall guy . "	DT NN VBZ NN JJ IN VBG DT `` NN NN . ''
The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .	DT NN NNS VBP JJ JJ NNS IN NNP CC PRP CC PRP$ NNS VBP CC VBP DT JJ NN RB .
His press release following the hearing renewed the call for " refunds . "	PRP$ NN NN VBG DT NN VBD DT NN IN `` NNS . ''
On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .	IN PRP$ NN , NNP NNP VBD NNP CC NNP TO VB PRP IN DT NNS IN DT NNS PRP VBD TO VB PRP$ NN RB IN NNS .

Bilbray joined the " gouging " band wagon .	NNP VBD DT `` NN '' NN NN .
The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a " real " investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works .	DT NNS RB VBD IN NNP TO VB DT `` JJ '' NN , IN NNS , NN , NN NN , DT NNS .
On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .	IN DT JJ NN , DT NNP NNS VBD NNP , PRP$ NN , CC PRP$ NNS IN DT NN .
Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California 's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .	NNP VBD RB RB IN DT NN IN NNP POS NN NN VBZ PRP JJ TO VB RP DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
He also stated that just everyone 's just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .	PRP RB VBD IN RB NN VBZ RB VBG IN PRP$ JJ NN HYPH NN , VBG IN DT VBN NNS VBN IN DT NN .
IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .	NN : PRP VBZ JJ IN NNP TO VB RBR PRP$ NNS IN VBG VBN .
In the best case , the clamoring for a " refund " subsides .	IN DT JJS NN , DT NN IN DT `` NN '' VBZ .
In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .	IN WDT NN , DT JJ NN IN NNP VBZ DT JJ NN VBN TO VB RBR DT NNS IN VBG VBN .
In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) " played by the rules , " but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers .	IN DT JJ NN , NNS VBP IN NNP -LRB- IN NNS -RRB- `` VBD IN DT NNS , '' CC DT NNS VBD , CC NNP VBD IN DT NN IN NNP NNS .

following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i do nt think it s necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement .	VBG RP IN PRP$ NN NN , IN DT NNS IN NNS , PRP VBP RB VB PRP VBZ JJ TO VB PDT DT NN IN PRP$ NN POS NN TO VB IN DT NN .
these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .	DT VBP JJ NN NNS CC VBG DT NN MD VB PRP TO VB NN IN JJ NNS VBP RB VB JJ JJ NNS .
the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .	DT JJ NN PRP VBP DT NNS VBZ IN DT NN WRB DT NN VBZ DT NN NN IN DT JJ HYPH JJ NN , VBZ $ CD CD , CC RB VBZ IN PRP VBD RB DT JJ NN .
in our case , they are only hedging .	IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP RB VBG .
we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .	PRP VBP VBG DT NN IN NN CC PRP$ JJ NN VBZ VBN IN NN .
therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .	RB PRP MD RB VB TO VB DT NN .
even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .	RB IN PRP VBD , PRP$ NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN , RB DT JJ NN .
the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .	DT NN IN VBG NN VBZ RB JJR IN DT NN IN DT NN VBG TO VB PRP$ NN RP .
seems like a 5 second decision to me .	VBZ IN DT CD NN NN IN PRP .
is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?	VBZ PRP JJ TO VB DT JJ NN CC PRP$ NN IN DT JJ JJ NN .
by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .	IN VBG RB IN DT JJ NN RB PRP MD VB DT NNS IN DT NN NN VBZ RB CD HYPH NN .

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .	PRP VBP VBN TO VB DT NNS WDT NNP VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN NN NN WDT NNP VBZ VBN IN NN IN DT JJ NN .
Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .	VBN UH VB DT NN JJ NN -LRB- IN DT NN NN NN -RRB- IN PRP$ NN .
Please note the following as you review :	UH VB DT VBG IN PRP VBP :
1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer 's utility .

2 . I did not include a " Setoff " provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers .	LS . PRP VBD RB VB DT `` NN '' NN IN DT NN , RB IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , PRP MD RB , CC MD DT NN , VB DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS .
If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .	IN PRP VBP RB IN PRP$ VBG DT NN NN , PRP MD VB RB .
3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .	LS . DT NN IN NN NN VBZ DT NN RB IN DT JJ NN , DT NN RB VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ RB JJ CC RB JJ -LRB- CC PRP VBP VBN JJ NN VBG PRP IN DT NN -RRB- .
Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .	VBG IN NN DT NN IN NN , PRP VBD TO VB JJ NNS , VBG PRP$ NN TO VB PRP$ NNS IN IN DT NN IN NN , NNS CC NNS IN DT `` NN NN NN '' IN DT NN TO VB DT NN -LRB- VB DT NNS -RRB- .
Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of " saving space " than anything else ...	RB PRP VBP RB VB NN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ , RB , RBR IN DT NN IN `` VBG NN '' IN NN JJ .
Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .	VB PRP VB PRP$ NNS IN DT NN CC IN PRP VBP JJ IN PRP$ VBG DT IN JJ NN IN DT NN NN VBZ VBN .

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt " betrayed " by the actions of Winter .	NNP NN NNP NNP VBD DT NN VBD `` JJ '' IN DT NNS IN NNP .
" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis , " Maviglio said .	`` DT NN VBZ PRP VBD DT VBG NN , WRB WP VBD DT VBG NN VBD IN DT JJ NN , '' NNP VBD .
Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .	NNP VBD NN , VBG DT NNS IN DT JJ NNS NN .
ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn 's committee will find no criminal conduct .	NNP NN NNP NNP VBD NNP POS NN MD VB DT JJ NN .
The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .	DT NN VBD VBN IN NNP JJ NN IN CD NN IN NN : TO VB DT NNS RP .
At the time , generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps .	IN DT NN , NNS VBD VBG TO VB NN IN NNP IN IN DT NN NNS .
" It was an emergency , " Fishman said .	`` PRP VBD DT NN , '' NNP VBD .

What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .	WP VBD JJ IN DT NN NN VBD IN NNP CD WRB NNP NN NNS VBD IN JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NN NN NNS MD VB IN NN .
The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .	DT NNS MD VB NNS RB JJ IN $ CD IN NN , RB CD NNS IN DT $ CD IN NN NNS IN CD NNS RBR .
" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much , " said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March .	`` PRP -LRB- NN NNS -RRB- VBD CC VBD DT $ CD NN NN , CC DT JJ NN IN NNP VBD RB JJ , '' VBD NNP , WP$ NN VBZ VBN VBG IN NNP .
" All hell broke loose . ''	`` DT NN VBD RB . ''
Records show that on Oct. 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .	NNS VBP IN IN NNP CD , NN NNS CC NN NNS VBD NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP , VBG IN DT JJ NN VB VBN .
The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .	DT NNS , CD IN DT , VBD VBN IN CD NNS IN DT JJ CC VBD NNS IN NN NNS .
" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity , '' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III .	`` IN RB VBN RB , DT -LRB- NNP -RRB- NN NN MD VB NN IN DT NN , VB NN CC VB JJ NN IN NN NN , '' VBD CD NN VBN IN NNP NNP NN NN NNP NNP CD .
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .	IN EX VBZ NN JJ IN DT NNS VBG RB TO VB IN NN NNS , NNP VBZ DT NNS CC JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN VBD JJ NN IN NN NNS .
He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to " fix " prices , which would violate federal trade laws .	PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NNS MD VB TO VB IN NN VBD TO `` VB '' NNS , WDT MD VB JJ NN NNS .
In the Oct. 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps were n't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .	IN DT NNP CD NNS , NN NNS VBD JJ NNS IN IN NN NNS VBD RB VBN PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN NN .
The generators got their way .	DT NNS VBD PRP$ NN .
The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .	DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN VBD DT JJ NN NN .
What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .	WP VBD VBN IN NN VBD DT $ CD NN NN VBN CD NNS RBR .
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they could n't make a profit even under these constraints .	NN NNS RB VBD PRP$ NN IN VBG DT NN , VBG PRP MD RB VB DT NN RB IN DT NNS .
They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .	PRP VBD TO VB NN IN NNP , CC IN NNP CD DT NNP VBD PRP$ JJ NN CD NN CC VBD IN NNS , WDT VBD RB VBN .
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .	WP VBD DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN CC NNP TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN .
Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .	NNP , WP IN PRP$ NN IN NN CC JJ VBG NN IN DT NNP , VBD DT CD HYPH NN NN NN , VBG JJ NNS TO VB DT $ CD NN NN .
Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .	JJ NN IN VBG DT NN VBD IN DT JJ NN .
Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter 's actions until the cap had been removed .	CC DT NNP NN , WDT VBD VBN DT NN NN , CC DT NN VBD IN NNP POS NNS IN DT NN VBD VBN VBN .
In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .	IN NN , DT NN WP VBD VB DT NN NN , NNP NNP , VBD IN DT NN IN NNS IN DT NN CC NNP NN NNS RB NNS IN DT NN VBD VBN .
He did n't mention anything about it .	PRP VBD RB VB NN IN PRP .
" In retrospect , we should have told them , '' Robinson said .	`` IN NN , PRP MD VB VBN PRP , '' NNP VBD .
With the price caps gone , the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs .	IN DT NN NNS JJ , DT NNS VBD NN IN JJ NNS VBG JJR NNS .
" The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor 's key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment , '' Maviglio said .	`` DT NNP NN VBD IN DT NN IN DT NN POS JJ NN NNS IN NN NNS , RB VBG DT NN IN NN WDT VBD VBG RP IN DT RB JJ NN , '' NNP VBD .
" It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant .	`` PRP VBD IN NN IN PRP VBD TO VB NN RB JJ .
This action accelerated the utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power - buying business . "	DT NN VBD DT NNS POS NN IN NN CC VBD DT NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN HYPH VBG NN . ''
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO records show .	NNS IN NN VBD IN DT NN IN $ CD DT NN IN $ CD DT NN IN CD NNS , NNP NNS VBP .
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $ 30 billion .	NNP VBZ DT VBG NNS IN NN VBD $ CD CD .
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians .	NNP VBD DT NN , VBN CD NNS IN DT NN , VBD IN IN VBD NNPS .
Prices , he said , did not spike as a result .	NNS , PRP VBD , VBD RB VB IN DT NN .
Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity .	RB PRP VBD DT VBG NN IN JJ NN , WDT VBZ VBN TO VB NN NNS TO VB NN .
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .	NNP VBD DT NN NN VBD DT NNP TO VB NNS MD NNS IN NN VB VBN IN JJ NNS .
" We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern , '' Robinson said .	`` PRP VBP DT NN PRP VBD VBD DT JJ NN , '' NNP VBD .
" In our view , we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation .	`` IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBD RB VB PRP VBD CC VBD JJR DT JJ NN .
We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund . "	PRP VBD PRP VBD PRP JJR IN PRP VBD DT NN IN NN CC NN . ''
Jan Smutney - Jones , who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators , said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap .	NNP NNP HYPH NNP , WP VBD DT NNP NN NN IN DT NN CC JJ NN IN DT NN WDT VBZ NN NNS , VBD NNP VBD RB VB PRP IN VBG DT NN NN .
Smutney - Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .	NNP HYPH NNP RB VBD PRP VBD JJ IN NN IN DT NN HYPH NN NN VBG VBN .
" Terry did this by himself , '' said Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers .	`` NNP VBD DT IN PRP , '' VBD NNP HYPH NNP , JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP NNPS .
" He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing . "	`` PRP VBD WP PRP VBD VBD TO VB VBN IN DT NN TO VB DT NN VBG . ''
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions .	DT NNP NN VBD DT NN NN DT JJ NN VBG NNP VB PRP$ NNS .
Some board members pushed to have Winter removed , but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos , the governor 's spokesman Maviglio said .	DT NN NNS VBD TO VB NNP VBN , CC EX VBD NNS JJ NN MD VB IN JJR NN , DT NN POS NN NNP VBD .
James J. Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter .	NNP NNP NNP , DT JJ NNP NNP NNP NNP NN , VBD VBG DT NNP NN CC RB VBD NNP .
" They filed an emergency motion , and we were not about to let California go dark , '' Hoecker said .	`` PRP VBD DT NN NN , CC PRP VBD RB RB TO VB NNP VB JJ , '' NNP VBD .
" They ( ISO management ) did what any independent system operator would do . "	`` PRP -LRB- NNP NN -RRB- VBD WP DT JJ NN NN MD VB . ''
What Dunn 's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired .	WP NNP POS NN VBZ TO VB VBZ WRB PDT DT NNS VBD .
He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter 's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues .	PRP VBZ NNS CC NNS IN DT NN IN NNP POS NNP CD NNS MD VB JJ NNS .
" We do n't know why he did what he did , but we are eager to find out , " Dunn said .	`` PRP VBP RB VB WRB PRP VBD WP PRP VBD , CC PRP VBP JJ TO VB RP , '' NNP VBD .
" Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument has no basis in fact . ''	`` NNP VBD PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN NNPS , CC PRP VBP DT NN VBZ DT NN IN NN . ''

China 's insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .	NNP POS JJ NN IN NN VBZ VBG NNS IN JJ CC JJ NNS IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ JJ NNS IN NN IN RB RB RB IN NNP CC NNP .
An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China 's soaring economic growth .

Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol	VBN NN NN IN NNP VBZ VBG DT JJ NN IN NN
The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .

The submarine incident was put down to a " technical error " by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan .	DT NN NN VBD VBN RP IN DT `` JJ NN '' IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBD IN NNP .
But even before the incident the People 's Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was " only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy " .

The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .	DT NN , RB , VBZ VBN JJ NN IN DT NNS .

Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique	NNS IN DT JJ VBG NN
-----------------------------------------------	NFP
If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .	IN PRP VBP IN PRP RB VBP DT NN IN JJ NNS TO VB DT NN VB DT NN IN NN , VB DT VBG IN VBG IN DT RBR JJ NN RB .
Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .	NNS MD VB IN JJ NNS , CC NN VBZ JJR IN DT .
Meditation has to do with what is called ideation .	NN VBZ TO VB IN WP VBZ VBN NN .
It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .	PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB IN DT JJ JJ NN NN IN DT NN IN NNS VBN IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ IN DT NNS .
Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .	VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC VB IN PRP$ NNS VBN .
Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , keep eyes closed and keep tongue on the roof of your mouth .	VB PRP$ NNS CD IN NN IN DT JJ IN PRP$ NN , VB PRP$ NN JJ , VB NNS VBN CC VB NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose .	PRP$ NN MD VB JJ CC JJ , IN DT NN .
Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .	VB DT NN CC RB VBG IN PRP$ NN , VBG DT NN VBG IN PRP$ NNS .
1 . Warm Sun Visualization	LS . JJ NN NN
Continue to breathe slowly and deeply .	VB TO VB RB CC RB .
With each breath , feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness .	IN DT NN , VB DT NNS IN PRP$ NN VBG JJR CC JJR , CC RB PRP$ JJ NN CC JJ NNS VBP VBG IN PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN IN DT JJ JJ NN .
Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .	VB DT NN VBG RB IN PRP VBP VBG RB CC RB .
Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .	VB PRP VBG IN DT JJ , JJ NN VBG IN DT NN IN DT NN , .

Everything around you is so vast .	NN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ .

Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .	VB TO VB IN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN TO VB IN DT DT JJ NN .
And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ) .	CC IN VBG RB VB VBG DT NN NN NN NN -LRB- VB RB IN NN NN , VB RB IN NN -RRB- .
Try this for 5 to 10 minutes .	VB DT IN CD IN CD NNS .
Now come back to earth again - slowly .	RB VB RB IN NNP RB , RB .
Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .	VB PRP VBG IN DT NN RB CC RB .
Your muscles are loose and limp .	PRP$ NNS VBP JJ CC JJ .

The sun 's rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .	DT NN POS NNS CC NN VBP RB IN PRP , VBG PRP .
You are in a state of peace and relaxation .	PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN CC NN .
With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .	IN DT NN , VB PRP$ NN CC VB IN PRP VBZ JJ , IN NN .
Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .	VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN RB IN PRP$ NN , VBG PRP RB CC RB .
You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .	PRP VBP TO VB NN RB IN PRP IN PRP$ JJ NN NN WRB PRP VBD PRP$ NN VBG IN DT JJ NN .
This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .	DT MD VB DT NN IN DT NN , DT JJ NN CC NN IN NN CC DT JJ NN .
Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .	VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN , VBG DT NN CC VBG RB RB IN DT NN .
A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .	DT JJ , JJ NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN CC VBZ PRP RB RBR .
Let your mind and body be totally at peace .	VB PRP$ NN CC NN VB RB IN NN .
Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .	RB VB PRP VBG IN WRB PRP VBP , VB PRP$ NNS CC NNS DT JJ , VB PRP .

2 . Mountain Visualization	LS . NN NN

Imagine you 're sitting on top of a mountain , and that it 's the most peaceful place you can think of .	VB PRP VBP VBG IN NN IN DT NN , CC IN PRP VBZ DT RBS JJ NN PRP MD VB IN .
Feel that you 're sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .	VB IN PRP VBP VBG RB IN JJ NN , RB IN NN IN DT NN .
Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .	RB VB IN JJ NN VBZ VBG PRP IN DT NN .
Feel you 're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .	VB PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT JJ NN CC NN .
Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .	RB VB TO VB IN PRP$ NN DT NN : NN NN NN .
Its meaning is " Infinite happiness is everywhere " .	PRP$ NN VBZ `` JJ NN VBZ RB '' .
Feel the meaning , do n't just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ) .	VB DT NN , VB RB RB VB IN PRP$ JJ NN CC VB TO VB IN NNP -LRB- NN NN NN -RRB- IN DT JJ NN -LRB- JJ NN CC NN -RRB- .
Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you 're repeating it .	VB RB , RB , RB IN NNS , IN DT NN , IN PRP VBP VBG PRP .
This is called ideation .	DT VBZ VBN NN .
It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .	PRP VBZ JJ TO VB DT NN , RB RB DT JJ NN .
Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .	VBG RB IN DT NN VBZ WP VBZ NN , PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .	RB , VBG TO VB CC VB IN JJ NNS VBZ DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN .
Feel you 're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .	VB PRP VBP VBN IN JJ NN CC NN , CC VB IN PRP$ JJ NN IN NN VBZ IN JJ NN IN DT JJ NN CC NN RB IN PRP .
You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .	PRP MD VB RB CC VB IN PRP$ NN NN , DT NN IN DT JJ NN , VBZ VBG IN NN .
Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .	VB IN RB RB IN PRP VBP , RB VB PRP$ NNS .
OK that is fairly basic :) .	UH DT VBZ RB JJ NFP .
The important point is to develop some psycho-spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .	DT JJ NN VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN CC DT JJ NN CC JJ NN .
Do n't worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that 's normal .	VB RB VB IN PRP VBP NN VBG IN DT NN CC NN , DT VBZ JJ .
It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .	PRP VBZ DT NN CC NN TO VB JJ TO VB IN DT CD NN .
The main thing is to keep practicing .	DT JJ NN VBZ TO VB VBG .
If you do n't practice , then nothing happens .	IN PRP VBP RB VB , RB NN VBZ .
Well maybe a miracle could happen , but let s face it we 're ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !	UH RB DT NN MD VB , CC VB PRP VB PRP PRP VBP JJ NNS CC RB VBP JJ NN IN NN NNS .

Under our Constitution , this nomination can not take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .	IN PRP$ NN , DT NN MD RB VB NN IN CC IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBZ PRP$ NN , IN VBN IN PRP$ NN , NN CD , NN CD .
A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt	DT NN IN DT NN , IN NNS RB IN DT JJ NN , VBZ VBN IN ADD
Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :	NN NNP NNP VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT IN DT JJ NNS VBN TO VB NNS IN DT NN :
He has a very high intellect .	PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .
He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .	PRP VBD RB RB IN PRP$ NN , IN NNP NN CC IN NN NN IN NNP .
He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .	PRP VBZ DT JJ CC JJ NN , VBG JJ NNS IN DT JJ NNS NN , DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP .
He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .	PRP VBZ JJ NN IN NNS IN JJ NNP NNP NNS , CC PRP MD VB NNS IN NN .
He demonstrates an excellent " Judicial Temperament , " being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail .	PRP VBZ DT JJ `` JJ NN , '' VBG JJ , JJ HYPH JJ , JJ IN DT NNS , JJ IN PRP$ NN , JJ IN NN .
His co-workers love him .	PRP$ NNS VBP PRP .
His fellow judges love him .	PRP$ JJ NNS VBP PRP .
His family loves him .	PRP$ NN VBZ PRP .
President Bush loves him .	NNP NNP VBZ PRP .
Yes , it is true that some people do n't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .	UH , PRP VBZ JJ IN DT NNS VBP RB VB DT NN PRP VBP PRP MD VB IN DT NNP NNP .
But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .	CC JJ NNS VBP VB DT NN PRP VBP PRP MD VB , CC DT NNS WP VBP PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS WP VBP PRP .
So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan. 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .	RB RB DT NNP VBZ VBG JJ TO VB RB , IN IN TO VB PRP CC RB , CC IN DT NN -LRB- NN IN NNP CD , CD -RRB- PRP VBZ IN PRP VBZ JJR IN DT CD HYPH CD NNS VBN IN NN .
The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .	DT NNP VBZ RB JJ TO VB RB RB CC VB DT NN , IN PRP RB RB VBZ TO VB NNP NNP IN DT NNP NNP , TO VB VBG DT NNS NNP VBZ JJ IN .
So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .	RB EX VBZ DT NN IN VB HYPH RP NN IN DT NNP TO VB PRP$ JJ NN IN NN .
There is an old saying that applies in this situation : " Act in haste , repent at leisure . "	EX VBZ DT JJ NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN : `` VB IN NN , VB IN NN . ''
Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .	RB PRP MD VB DT JJ NN RB RB , RB VB PRP IN JJ NNS TO VB .
That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .	DT VBZ WP VBZ JJ TO VB IN NN NNP NNP , IN PRP$ NN , IN PRP VBZ CD JJ NN , DT RB JJ JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , WDT VBZ PRP RB JJ IN DT NN IN NNP NNP NN : PRP VBZ RB RB VB IN DT NN IN `` NNS CC NNS '' VBN IN DT NN , CC PRP VBZ JJ TO VB VBG PRP RP IN NN TO VB DT `` NNP NNP NNP , '' WDT VBZ IN RB HYPH VBN JJ NN IN DT NN IN NNP CC DT NNP NNP .
And because of this tragic flaw . . .	CC IN IN DT JJ NN . . .
" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President . "	`` PRP MD VB RP PRP$ NN IN NNS CC NNS , VBG RB RB JJ NN IN DT NNP . ''
In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .	IN PRP$ JJ NN , PRP VBP CD NNS IN DT NNP NNP : DT JJ , JJ , CC JJ NNS .
And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .	CC DT JJ NN IN DT NNS CC NNS PRP VBP VBZ IN IN CD NN IN DT NN VBZ JJ , DT JJ CD MD VB PRP RB .
But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .	CC NNP NNP VBZ IN DT RB HYPH VBN JJ NN , VBN DT `` NNP NNP NNP '' , WDT VBZ IN DT NNP MD VB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , CC IN DT JJ NN MD VB IN NN IN RB NN WDT DT NN RB VBZ , VBG DT NNS IN DT JJ NNS WDT VBD VBN TO VB JJ IN JJ NN , CC DT NN , WDT VBZ , WDT VBZ VBN , CC WDT VBZ VBN IN JJ NN VBN IN DT NN IN NNP , RB IN DT NNP .
The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .	DT NN VBZ RB NN IN DT JJ NN : PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
" Commander In Chief " does n't mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely mean that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with " executing faithfully " all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court .	`` NNP IN NNP '' VBZ RB VB IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN , RB VB IN PRP VBZ DT NN , RB IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN , VBN IN `` VBG RB '' PDT DT NNS VBN IN NNP CC PDT DT NNS VBN IN DT NNP NNP .
Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .	IN DT NNP NNP NNP , DT NNS IN NNP CC NNS IN DT NNP NNP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NNP VBZ IN PRP .
And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .	CC RB NNP CC DT NNP NNP VB JJ NNS IN DT NNP , IN DT JJ NN IN PRP .
And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .	CC DT NNP VBZ DT NN , JJ IN NN IN DT NN , VBN RP IN DT JJ NNS , WDT MD VB RB IN PRP$ JJ NN .
And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .	CC RB DT NNP NNP IN NNP , DT NN IN DT JJ CC DT NN IN DT JJ , VBZ RB DT JJ NN , RB JJR IN NNP NNP CC JJ NNP IN NNP NNP CD .
AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .	CC DT VBZ WRB DT NNPS MD VB DT NN IN NNP NNP .

Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood 's grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .	RB IN PRP VBD RP NNP NNP NNP POS NN CC VBD RP DT NNS IN CD HYPH NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNPS , DT NNP NNP NNP VBZ VBN DT RB JJ NN .
In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan 's Lake Superior .	IN NN IN IN DT NN , DT JJ NN VBD RB VBN IN DT JJ CD NNS IN DT NNS , IN IN DT JJ NN NN IN NNP NNP NNP NNP IN NNP POS NNP NNP .
The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .	DT JJ NN VBD VBN IN NNP NNP NNP IN CD .
Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .	JJ NNS CC NNS NNS , IN WP$ NN DT NN NN VBD VBN , RB VBD PRP$ NNS IN DT NN CC VBD PRP RP IN DT NN RB VBN .
Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .	PRP$ NNS MD VB , PRP$ NNS MD VB CC RB DT JJ NN MD VB VBN .
After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .	IN DT JJ NN HYPH NNS , NNS IN IN NNP CC NNP VBD RB IN NN .
Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .	IN NNS CC NNP , JJ NNS VBD TO VB JJ JJ NNS , RB IN NNP .
In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .	IN DT NNS , DT NN VBG DT NN IN DT NNP NN RB VBD DT JJ NNS , RB VBD PRP WRB PRP$ NN VBD JJ .
If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .	IN RB , DT JJ NN VBZ RB VBN VBN IN RB .
Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .	NN RB VBD PRP DT JJ NN VBD DT VBN NN IN NNP CC VBD PRP IN DT NN RB IN DT NNS , VBG TO VB DT VBG NN .
If true , the caper failed .	IN JJ , DT NN VBD .
Over time , the wolf 's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .	IN NN , DT NN POS NN VBD TO VB PRP$ NN .
Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .	RB , DT NN IN NN VBD IN VBG DT NN RB IN PRP$ JJ NN NN IN DT JJ NNP NNPS .
This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .	DT NN VBD IN DT NN , VBG IN CD NNS VBG VBN IN NNP IN CD IN DT NNP NNP CC NNP NNP , IN IN DT JJ CC RB HYPH VBG NNS IN NNS .
These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .	DT NN NNS VBP VBN , CC RB EX VBP DT VBN CD NNS VBG DT JJ NNPS , WRB RB CD NNS RB EX VBD NN .
One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .	CD JJ NN IN NN VBD DT NN VBZ IN DT NN NN , DT NN WDT VBZ DT NNS , NN CC NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS IN PRP$ NN .
Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .	DT JJ NN VBN IN NNP NNP NNP VBZ VBN JJ NN IN DT NN .
OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of " the ecology of fear " -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf 's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs .	NNP NN NNS NNP NNP CC NNP NNP VBP VBN IN NNS RB VB NN HYPH NN NN , IN PRP VBP VBN DT NN DT JJ NN IN `` DT NN IN NN '' , NN WDT VBZ IN DT JJ NN VBG IN DT NN POS NNS IN NNP NNP CC DT NNP NNPS .
They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .	PRP VBD IN NNS IN NNP VBD TO VB JJ IN JJ NN CC NN VBG IN DT NNS IN NNS , DT NN WDT VBD DT NNS IN VBG JJ NNS CC VBD DT NN IN NN NN .
Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .

" All you have to do is look at the photographs , " Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI 's Blue Planet ,	`` DT PRP VBP TO VB VBZ VB IN DT NNS , '' NNP NNP , NN NN NN IN DT NNP NNP CC NNP NNP , VBD NNP POS NNP NNP ,
" You say , ' wow ! '	`` PRP VBP , `` UH . ''

This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .	DT JJ NN VBZ VBN DT JJ JJ NN IN NNP .
More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .	JJR JJ NN CC NN VBP VBN JJR NN IN NNS , IN NN .
Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park 's northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .	WRB EX VBD VBN RB CD NN NN IN DT NN POS JJ NN IN DT NNS VBD , RB EX VBP CD .
" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people , " Beschta told Blue Planet .	`` PRP MD VB JJ IN DT NN IN NNS , '' NNP VBD NNP NNP .

But we 've been looking at streamside communities .	CC PRP VBP VBN VBG IN JJ NNS .

" Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change , " said Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world 's leading experts on this issue .	`` NN IN DT NNS VBP JJ NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN CC NN NN , '' VBD NNP NNP , DT NNP IN NNP HYPH NNP NN CC CD IN DT NN POS VBG NNS IN DT NN .
These changes are occurring across all species , Parmesan told UPI 's Climate .	DT NNS VBP VBG IN DT NNS , NNP VBD NNP POS NNP .
" Across the United States , the northern edge of species ' range is expanding , " she said .	`` IN DT NNP NNP , DT JJ NN IN NNS POS NN VBZ VBG , '' PRP VBD .
Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .	NNP VBZ VBN JJ IN PRP$ NN VBG DT NN NN , WDT VBZ IN NNP CC JJ NNP .

" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable . "	`` EX VBP VBN JJ NNS IN NN NNS IN NNP CC JJ NNP IN NNS WRB DT NN VBZ RB JJ . ''
According to Parmesan 's earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .

Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .	JJ NNS VBP NN CC , IN DT NNS , NN IN NNS CC NNS IN NN NN IN NNS .
The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .	DT NN RB VBD NNS IN NN NNS JJ IN NN NN CC NN .
The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to " being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 .

The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the " Arctic Climate Impact Assessment . "	DT NNP NN VBD IN DT NN IN NNP IN DT `` NNP NNP NNP NNP . ''

" Should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction , " the report concluded .	`` MD DT NNP NNP VB NN HYPH JJ IN NN , PRP VBZ JJ IN JJ NNS CC DT NN NNS MD VB VBN IN NN , '' DT NN VBD .
As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .	IN IN RB JJ NN NN , RB NN VBZ IN DT JJ NNS .
A third report , " The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future , " completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category .

On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .	IN DT JJ NN , DT NN VBZ DT NN MD RB VB RB JJ IN DT NNP NNP NNS .
" The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge , " the IPN report said .	`` DT NN IN JJ NN IN NN NNS CC NNS VBZ JJ TO VB , '' DT NNP NN VBD .
" A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic . "	`` DT NN IN DT NN VBN VBZ RBR JJ IN RB TO VB JJ IN DT NNS IN DT NNP NNP . ''
The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster .

The IPN report examines commercial fish species , but it neglects important non-commercial animals , such as seals and polar bears .	DT NNP NN VBZ JJ NN NNS , CC PRP VBZ JJ JJ NNS , JJ IN NNS CC JJ NNS .
In a limited economic sense , therefore , the organization can argue warming might be a good thing .	IN DT JJ JJ NN , RB , DT NN MD VB NN MD VB DT JJ NN .

HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?	NNS : MD DT NN VB JJ VBG IN DT NN .

There are some things to consider though ...	EX VBP DT NNS TO VB RB .
Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .	NNS VBP JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS TO VB PRP$ NN , CC DT VBZ TO VB VBN RB , CC PRP$ NN MD VB IN NNS IN DT NN IN NN IN PRP$ NN .
When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .	WRB PRP VBP DT NN NN CC VBP RP NN , PRP$ NN MD VB NN , DT NN MD VB JJ IN PRP , CC MD RB VB JJ TO VB DT NN RB IN PRP MD .
You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .	PRP MD RB VB TO VB JJ IN NN VBG IN DT NNS CC NN HYPH NNS PRP MD VB .
You also do n't want it getting too warm for him too often .	PRP RB VBP RB VB PRP VBG RB JJ IN PRP RB RB .
Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .	RB , PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN , CC PRP MD VB PRP JJ CC VB PRP RP IN PRP VBP DT NN TO VB PRP DT JJ NN PRP MD VB IN IN PRP .

Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I 'm certain it does n't ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .

The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box .	DT NN MD VB RB IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN NN .
On the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank .	IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , PRP MD VB DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN WDT VBZ DT NN RB IN PRP$ NN .

The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .	DT JJS NN PRP MD VB IN NNP VBZ TO VB IN DT NN .
Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .	RB , PRP MD VB WP PRP MD VB IN JJ NNS IN NNP , IN NN , NN , FW .

Modern m 16 vs Vietnam m 16 version ?	JJ NN CD IN NNP NN CD NN .

What is Italian High Renaissance ?	WP VBZ JJ JJ NNP .
Have a look at this , it may help .	VB DT NN IN DT , PRP MD VB .
1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .	LS -RRB- DT NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NNP , DT NN IN JJ JJ NN CC NN IN NNP WDT VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN RB CD , VBG DT NN IN JJ CC JJ JJ NNP .
The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .	DT NN NNP VBZ IN NN DT JJ NN WDT VBD IN NN IN DT JJ NN , IN DT NN IN NNS JJ IN NNP NNP .
Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .

The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ” , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .	DT NN NNP -LRB- NNP IN NNP -RRB- VBZ `` NN '' , CC DT NN VBZ RBS VBN IN DT VBN NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN IN DT NN WDT NNP NNS VBD DT NNP NNPS .

The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .

Feather Type .	NN NN .
Silkies have hookless feathers .	NNS VBP JJ NNS .

Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .	UH , PRP VBP DT NN NN IN CD NNS .
You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .	PRP VBP TO VB WP VBZ VBN DT NN NN NN .

you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .	PRP VBP RB RB VBG NN , PRP$ NN VBZ VBG PRP$ NN .
territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .	NN VBZ RB JJ IN NNS , CC PRP VBP RB JJ WRB PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN MD VB JJ IN NNS , CC JJ NNS , UH RB RBS PRP VBZ RB .
you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .	PRP MD VB TO VB PRP RB DT JJ NN TO VB , IN PRP MD VB PRP PRP$ NN , CC VB JJ RB .
then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .	RB , PRP MD VB DT NN TO VB IN WRB PRP VBZ JJ .
you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .	PRP MD VB TO VB PRP$ NN CC NNS , CC WDT NN CC NNS VBP PRP$ , CC VBP IN NN , CC VBD PRP IN DT NN .
the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ) , but others will work just as well .	DT NN PRP VBP IN VBZ JJS -LRB- VBG PRP RB JJ IN PRP VBP VBG MD VB DT NN IN NN VBZ JJ -RRB- , CC NNS MD VB RB RB RB .

he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .	PRP MD VB RB JJR IN DT CD NN , IN IN DT JJ JJ NN .
he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .	PRP MD VB DT NN , VB NN IN PRP$ NN , CC VB TO VB PRP VBD IN PRP$ NN .
he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else 's territory when he is in a new house .	PRP MD VB PRP IN DT JJ NN VBZ IN RB , CC IN DT JJ NN MD VB RB : PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP VBZ IN NN JJ POS NN WRB PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN .
in a week 's time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .	IN DT NN POS NN , PRP MD VB VBN PRP PRP$ , CC MD VB VBG JJR JJ IN JJ .
let him out for half an hour , to explore .	VB PRP RP IN PDT DT NN , TO VB .
then put him back in .	RB VB PRP RB RB .
he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .	PRP MD VB VBN RP , RB VBG RB IN PRP$ NN MD VB PRP RB JJR .
extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .	VB DT NN PRP VBZ RB DT NN , CC IN DT JJ NN , RB VB PRP IN PRP$ NN IN NN , IN PRP VBZ JJ TO VB .
soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .	RB PRP MD VB DT JJ NN PRP$ , CC PRP VBZ DT CD JJ NN TO VB IN .
remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .	VB TO VB IN PRP IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN , CC VB PRP WRB JJ PRP VBZ .
remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .	VB TO VB PRP DT NN PRP VBZ TO VB IN DT NN VBZ PRP$ : VBP PRP , CC PRP MD VB JJ IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN .

To answer your questions in order :	TO VB PRP$ NNS IN NN :
1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .	LS -RRB- PRP VBZ RB JJ IN NNS TO VB VBG , RB RBR TO VB NN IN PRP .
However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .	RB , IN PRP VBP VBN VBG JJ NNS , RB DT NN MD VB IN IN NN IN DT NN CC NNS .
He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .	PRP MD RB VB NNP , DT NN JJ NN , CC DT NN IN NNS .
Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays ) ?	VBD PRP$ NN VB NNS -LRB- NN HYPH NNS -RRB- .
2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they did n't think it would be helpful .	LS -RRB- PRP$ NN MD RB VB PRP IN PRP VBD RB VB PRP MD VB JJ .
3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .	LS -RRB- IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN , RB VB PRP RB IN PRP$ NN .
It could be due to nausea or any number of things .	PRP MD VB IN IN NN CC DT NN IN NNS .
He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ) .	PRP MD VB JJ JJ -LRB- RB IN PRP VBZ TO VB CC VB NN -RRB- .
From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .	IN RB PRP VBP RP IN NN NNS , WDT MD VB IN NN CC NN NNS .
And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just does n't feel good .	CC VBG JJ , VBG , CC VBG NN RB VBZ RB VB JJ .

you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .	PRP VBD RB VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB RB .
you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .	PRP VBP TO VB DT IN RB RBS DT NN , CC RB DT NN IN JJ NN MD VB .
giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .	VBG DT JJ NN PRP$ JJ JJ NN MD VB PRP TO VB JJ CC MD VB PRP DT NN TO VB IN WRB JJ .
right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .	RB RB , PRP$ NN VBZ VBG RP DT NN , CC PRP VBZ IN DT IN DT NN VBZ PRP$ .
put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .	VB PRP$ RP IN DT NN , CC VB DT NN JJ IN DT NN .
then let her out for ten minutes .	RB VB PRP RP IN CD NNS .
make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .	VB PRP CD DT JJ NN , RB CD , CC RB RB .
this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .	DT MD VB CD NNS , DT JJ NN MD VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN , VBG PRP PRP$ NN .
she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she does n't now .	PRP MD VB TO VB RP CC VB JJ : PRP MD VB PRP VBZ RB RB .

give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .	VB PRP NN TO VB RP PRP$ NNS , CC IN PRP VB DT JJ NN RP , VB DT NN IN NN IN DT NN .

that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .	DT MD VB TO VB PRP , CC PRP MD VB RBR JJ IN PRP$ .
when they play fight , they do n't hiss .	WRB PRP VB VBP , PRP VBP RB VB .

if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .	IN PRP VBP , CC CD VBZ , PRP MD VB PRP , CC PRP MD VB DT NN IN PRP .
hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .	NN VBZ JJ , IN PRP VBP TO VB .

What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?	WP VBD DT NN IN NNP NNP IN DT NNP NNP .

He did not give them the number of troops they requested .	PRP VBD RB VB PRP DT NN IN NNS PRP VBD .

Bearded dragon question ... ?	JJ NN NN , .

Any advice would be greatly appreciated .	DT NN MD VB RB VBN .
Thank you for your time .	VBP PRP IN PRP$ NN .
Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of " light , " UVA , UVB , and heat .	VB PRP VB TO VB DT RP RB RB IN PRP MD : JJ -LRB- JJ IN DT NN NN -RRB- NNS IN DT JJ NN VBP CD NNS IN `` NN , '' NN , NN , CC NN .
Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that 's the easy one to provide for .	DT NN NN VBG NN NN MD VB NN , VBG NN NNS , DT VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB IN .
UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .	NN IN DT JJ NN MD RB VB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .	NN MD RB VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN , IN PRP VBP DT NN -LRB- NN NN NN -RRB- WDT VBZ DT JJ NN NN NN WDT MD VB CC NN CC NN IN CD NN .
I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .	PRP RB VBP IN PRP VBP RB VB JJ , JJ NN NNS IN PRP VBP VBN TO VB JJ NN NN CC , CC NN IN NNS RB TO VB PRP VBP NN VBG NN NN IN NN .
The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed 's Repsitun model : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturer s recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .	DT JJ NN NN NNS VBP JJS , IN NNP POS NNP NN : ADD VB TO VB NN NNS VBG IN DT NN POS NN IN WDT NN DT NN MD RB RBR VB NN RB IN JJ NN RB VBZ .
So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have " the sun 's rays " that your bearded needs .	RB , TO VB PRP$ NN , UH , IN PRP RB VBP DT NN WDT VBZ PRP VBZ NNP RB PRP VBP RB VB `` DT NN POS NNS `` WDT PRP$ VBN VBZ .
You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .	PRP VBP TO RB VB DT NN IN NNP NN .

DT NN IN NNP VBZ RB JJ , IN NN PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN TO RB VB WP JJS NN NN NNS VBP PRP , PRP VBP RB VB DT JJS NN NN VBG VBG JJ NN NN NN .
UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .	NNP CC VBG NN -LRB- MD VB RB CD NNP IN DT NN , CD NNP IN DT NN -RRB- MD VB JJ IN CD SYM CD NNS DT NN .
Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .	VB VBN NN VBZ RB DT JJ NN NN NN , PRP VBP TO VB JJ NN NNS .
Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .	JJ NNS VBP JJ NNS , PRP VBP TO VB DT NN VB TO VB DT VBG NN , RB WRB PRP VBP NNS .
Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .	NNP NN VBZ RB JJR IN JJ NN IN JJ JJ .
Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .	NNS , NN NNS , JJ NNS , CC JJ NN NNS , IN VBN , NN , NN , CC NN , VBP JJ NN IN NN NNS TO VB PRP$ VBN .
Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety 's sake .	NNP NNS CC JJ NNS MD RB VB VBN IN JJ NNS , IN NN POS NN .

if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3 x 5 x 4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if it s a small tank and he ca n't escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .

When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .	WRB VBG DT NN VB IN DT JJ NN .
( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ) .	-LRB- DT JJR DT JJR TO VB -RRB- VB IN JJ JJ NNS , NN , CC JJ NN NNS -LRB- DT NNS IN DT NN , JJ NN NNS VBZ DT NN VBZ RB JJ -RRB- VB IN DT JJ NN IN DT NNS -LRB- DT JJR NNS VBP DT NN NN IN PRP$ NNS -RRB- .

the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .	DT NNS VBP IN NN DT JJR NNS DT JJR .
